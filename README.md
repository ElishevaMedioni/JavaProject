<h4> Creating 3D images in Java using agile and test-driven software development methodologies. </h4>

<b> The project involved:</b>

:triangular_ruler: Figuring out the linear algebra behind the scenes <br/>
:keyboard: Writing the code in Java <br/>
:beetle: Evaluating the code by creating unit tests and images <br/>

<br/>

<b> Steps of the Project: </b>

- Introduction to OOP with Java
- Implementation of primitives with operations, geometries
- Implementation of geometries primitives' unit testing for primitives (JUnit). Implementation of normal calculation and their unit testing through geometries.
- Implementation of ray-geometry intersections and their unit testing through geometries.
- Implementation of camera class, rays through view plane construction and unit testing of camera
- Implementation of ambient light, scene, render and image- writer classes with their appropriate test units
- Adding material support. Implementation of Phong model, with light emission, directional, point and spot lighting, multiple light sources
- Implementation of shadow rays, reflection and refraction
- Implementation of a picture improvement algorithm (We choose Super Sampling)
- Implementation of a performance improvement algorithm (Adaptive Super Sampling)
